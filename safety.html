          Meeting new pups is exciting, but you should always be a cautious
          canine when sniffing out new friends. Use your best doggy judgment and
          put your safety first, whether you're exchanging your first barks or
          meeting at the park. While you can't control the actions of other
          pups, there are things you can do to help you stay safe during your
          NoseBoop adventure.

                  Never send treats, toys, or your favorite bone to another pup,
                  even if they claim to be in a "ruff" situation. Once a treat
                  is gone, it's hard to get it back! Never share information
                  that could help another dog dig up your secret stash. If
                  another pup asks for treats, report it to us immediately.

                <li>
                  <strong>Protect Your Personal Information:</strong> Don't
                  share your collar tag number, your human's address, or details
                  about your daily walk route with pups you don't know. If
                  you're a parent-pup, limit the info you share about your
                  puppies in your profile and early barks. Avoid sharing their
                  names, where they go to obedience school, or their favorite
                  chew toy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Stay on NoseBoop:</strong> Keep your barks and tail wags
                  on NoseBoop while you're getting to know a new friend. Because
                  NoseBoop is a safe space, sneaky dogs with bad intentions might
                  try to move the conversation to other hydrants (apps or texts)
                  right away.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Be Wary of Long-Distance and Overseas Pups:</strong>
                  Watch out for pups who say they're from your dog park but are
                  stuck in another city, especially if they ask for help to get
                  home. Be wary of any dog who won't meet in person or bark on a
                  video call—they might not be who they say they are. If a pup
                  avoids your questions or wants to be best friends right away,
                  that's a red flag.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Report All Suspicious and Ruff Behavior:</strong> You
                  know when a pup's crossed the line. Block and report any dog
                  that breaks the rules. Here are some examples:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Requests for treats or toys</li>
                    <li>Underage puppies</li>
                    <li>Growling, barking, or offensive messages</li>
                    <li>
                      Inappropriate or harmful behavior during or after a
                      playdate
                    </li>
                    <li>Fake profiles (cats pretending to be dogs!)</li>
                    <li>Spam or attempts to sell products</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Protect Your Account:</strong> Pick a strong password
                  (not "woofwoof123"), and be careful when logging in from a
                  public computer at the dog café. NoseBoop will never ask for
                  your password in an email—if you get one, report it!

                <li>
                  <strong>Don't Be In A Rush:</strong> Take your time and get to
                  know the other pup before agreeing to meet or sniff butts in
                  the park. Don't be afraid to ask questions to sniff out any
                  red flags. A video bark can be a good way to check them out
                  before meeting.

                <li>
                  <strong>Meet in Public and Stay in Public:</strong> Meet for
                  the first few times in a busy dog park or pet-friendly
                  café—never at your doghouse or theirs. If your new friend
                  wants to go somewhere private, end the playdate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Tell Your Pack About Your Plans:</strong> Let your
                  human or your pack know where you're going and when. Keep your
                  collar tag (phone) charged and with you at all times.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Be in Control of Your Transportation:</strong> Make
                  sure you have a way to get home—don't rely on your new friend
                  for a ride. Have a backup plan, like a human on standby or a
                  ride-share app.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Know Your Limits:</strong> Be aware of how many treats
                  or sips from the water bowl you can handle—don't let another
                  pup pressure you into more than you're comfortable with.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Don't Leave Treats or Toys Unattended:</strong> Keep
                  an eye on your treats and toys at all times. Only accept
                  snacks from trusted humans (bartenders or servers). Keep your
                  leash, collar, and anything with your info on you at all
                  times.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>If You Feel Uncomfortable, Leave:</strong> It's okay
                  to end the playdate early if you're not feeling it. Trust your
                  instincts—if something feels off, ask a human for help.

                  <strong>Be Careful While Traveling:</strong> If you're a
                  globe-trotting pup, check the local rules before you wag your
                  tail in a new place. Some parks have special rules for certain
                  breeds or types of dogs. If you're in a new territory,
                  consider hiding your profile until you're back in a safe spot.
